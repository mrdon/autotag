This site contains raw, unedited photos posted in real time, directly from my camera, usually a Sony Alpha 9 Mark 2. If you like one, please download it as I make no guarantees about a photo being available, and in fact, I clean out old ones periodically. 

If you'd like a photo removed, please email me and I'll do it ASAP.

Unless otherwise stated, photos are available under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license]
(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). In simple terms, 
use them however you'd like, including commercial use, as long as you give me (Don Brown) credit.
